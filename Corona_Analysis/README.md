# Corona Virus Dataset Analysis using SQL

## Introduction
This SQL project consists of various queries aimed at analyzing COVID-19 data stored in a database. The dataset includes information such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for different countries over time. The queries are designed to answer specific questions related to the dataset.

## Questions Solved
Below are the questions addressed by the SQL queries in this project:

1. Write a code to check NULL values.
2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns.
3. Check the total number of rows.
4. Check what is start_date and end_date.
5. Number of months present in the dataset.
6. Find the monthly average for confirmed, deaths, and recovered.
7. Find the most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month.
8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, and recovered per year.
9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year.
10. The total number of cases of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month.
11. Check how the coronavirus spread out with respect to confirmed cases (total confirmed cases, their average, variance, and STDEV).
12. Check how the coronavirus spread out with respect to death cases per month (total confirmed cases, their average, variance, and STDEV).
13. Check how the coronavirus spread out with respect to recovered cases (total confirmed cases, their average, variance, and STDEV).
14. Find the country having the highest number of confirmed cases.
15. Find the country having the lowest number of death cases.
16. Find the top 5 countries having the highest recovered cases.
